      There are two ways
      1.  to add things in HashSet for one List and then check if its adding the second one.
      2. start parsing the lists and if one is ending, point it to the head of the second one and vise versa. that way, the total number of nodes both
      the lists will be parsing will be equal and so, if there is a matching Node, it will come up. If not, at some point,
       they both will point to null adn so, it will return null.
